# chesspuzzles
A short program which sorts through a .CSV list of Lichess puzzles, and looks for ones rated between 1600 and 1800 and outputs a URL to the puzzle found.

PS: This was the first time I actually programmed a full-on project (albeit this is a VERY minor one). It took me ~3 hours to actually get my laptop to install an IDE and then for me to make this program and then use a compiler (20 minutes of actual programming if we were to ignore the set-up time).
