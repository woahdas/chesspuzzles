# chesspuzzles
A short program which sorts through a .CSV list of Lichess puzzles, and looks for ones rated between 1600 and 1800 and outputs a URL to the puzzle found.

PS: This was the first time I actually programmed a full-on project (albeit this is a VERY minor one). It took me ~3 hours to actually get my laptop to install an IDE and then for me to make this program and then use a compiler (30 minutes of actual programming if we were to ignore the set-up time).

This didn't exactly work on Visual Studio, but it did say it succeeded, and that it ran without any problems. I'm not too much of a complainer, so I don't think I'll revamp this code until later. For now, I'll just sort through these CSV values on Excel manually, and solve the problems on my own.

Who knows, maybe I'll get to a 2000+ rating? Probably not.
